#### Part One ####

Prompt 1: The given code consists of performance related bugs.
 Can you detect them and classify the bug? The bug classes are as follows: "Missing parallelism", "Algorithm or Data Structure inefficiency", "Memory management", "Inefficient parallelization", "Micro-Architectural"
 The code is given as: "..."

Prompt 2: You classified the program as "Missing Parallelism". This bug class have several subclasses: "Vector parallelism", "GPU parallelism", "Instruction level parallelism", "Task parallelism". Which of the 
 subclasses does the bug belong to?

#### Part Two ####

Prompt 1: The given code is consists of performance bugs. Can you fix it? You can parallelize the code if possible, you can use prefetching (using builtin_prefetch()), you can consider data locality. 

Prompt 2: Can you create a perfect parallel C++ program doing the task "..."? The inefficient version of the code is given as: "...".
